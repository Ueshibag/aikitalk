# Aikitalk

Aikitalk is a web application designed to help aikidoists in their preparation to grade certification exams.
The supported grades are fifth to first kyu, then first to fourth dan.

## Installation

You can use the app here : [Aikitalk](https://georgie44.pythonanywhere.com)

## Usage

You start by selecting a level (kyu or dan), then a situation (tachi waza for example), then an attack.
Click the **Start** button and the app tells you the techniques you have to execute.

### Options

- **Grade** : select a kyu or a dan level.
- **Situation** : select a situation such as *suwari waza* or *tachi waza*. Note that the number of situations increases with the grade level.
- **Attack** : select an attack type like *shomen uchi* for example.
- **Intervalle** : specify the time interval between two techniques you are requested to execute. The interval range spans from 3 to 15 seconds.
- **Répétitions** : the app will repeat the requested techniques if you set this option. The range of this option is 0 (no repetition hence every technique is said only once) to 15 (every technique is said 16 times).
- **Kokyu Nage** : among the requested standard techniques, the app can ask for some kokyu nage which number increases with the grade level.
- **Droite & Gauche** : each technique has to be executed on the right and on the left.
- **Aléatoire** : techniques are said randomly if this option is checked.
- **Omote / Ura** : some techniques such as ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo or shiho nage have omote and ura forms. This option lets you select a specific form or even no particular request.
